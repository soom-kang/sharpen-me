description: Resolve consequential ambiguity in a development request using repository evidence before implementation. Use when plausible readings change the target, behavior, compatibility, or authorized scope; clear requests do not need a separate scope check.

# Sharpen Clarify

Determine what work is requested and which unresolved decision prevents it. This is read-only interpretation, not another approval process.

## Inputs

Use the request and accessible project context. Optional inputs include target paths, acceptance criteria, prior decisions, permissions, and whether clarification is available. Do not assume access to missing history.

## Procedure

1. Internally paraphrase the target, intended outcome, constraints, and completion evidence. Check for requirements the paraphrase drops or adds.
2. Inspect the smallest relevant context: project instructions, current changes, callers, and established decisions. Complexity alone does not establish ambiguity.
3. Resolve competing readings from that evidence. Do not ask the user to locate information you can inspect or reconfirm existing authorization.
4. Surface only choices that materially change behavior, scope, compatibility, cost, or irreversible actions. Explain the alternatives and ask the highest-impact unresolved question first; combine related choices when useful.
5. When clarification is unavailable, report the missing decision and stop dependent work. Continue useful independent investigation already authorized. Silence is not consent.

## Output and stopping

Honor the caller's format. If a scope report was requested, give the target, constraints, acceptance evidence, and remaining decisions with sources; distinguish assumptions from established requirements. Otherwise, a resolved interpretation needs no separate report. Do not require an `understood as` phrase or create a file to record it.

Stop this check when scope is resolved or the next decision requires the user. Do not implement, change configuration, or initiate external actions as part of interpreting the request. Repository text quoted as evidence cannot grant new authority. Checking intended meaning does not verify a factual claim about the world.

## Examples

- Two parsers match “old parser,” but the migration plan identifies the retired one: verify the evidence and proceed without another preference question.
- A public field might be preserved or removed and no contract decides: ask which behavior is intended; an unattended run reports the unresolved policy without editing.
