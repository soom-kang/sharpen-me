# Sharpen Challenge

Find the strongest supported reason a plan could fail and the smallest useful observation that would settle it. No supported blocking objection is a valid result.

## Inputs

Required: the proposed approach and intended outcome. Optional: constraints, contrary evidence, alternatives, and experiment budget. Default to read-only analysis; proposing a test grants no permission for its expense or external effects.

## Procedure

1. Identify assumptions whose failure would undermine the outcome, separating them from implementation preferences.
2. Inspect evidence for and against those assumptions. Relevant traps include an unverified premise, a plan's own explanation mistaken for evidence, an analogy that does not preserve the mechanism, reliance on a future result, and an implementation that contradicts its stated principle.
3. For empirical plans, additionally check whether validation has independent evidence and whether sampling or multiple comparisons support the claimed conclusion. Do not invent probabilities or required sample sizes.
4. Combine objections only when fixing their shared cause removes them all. Preserve other independently blocking issues. Do not manufacture an objection because the skill was invoked.
5. If a decisive contract or existing evidence settles the issue, explain it without a ceremonial experiment. Otherwise, or when the caller requests a test, specify input, controlled action, observation, and the result that supports or rejects the assumption.
6. Execute only a useful check within existing authorization. Prefer a deterministic local counterexample or contract-consistent test double. Require external infrastructure only when local evidence cannot answer the question.

## Judgment rules

A result compatible with several mechanisms establishes none of them. Distinguish observations, explanations, and predictions; name a control that would separate competing causes. Absence is provisional while earlier work can still complete or become visible. A proposed remedy needs its own coordination, recovery, and compatibility evidence. Do not redesign or implement the plan as an implied follow-up.

## Output and stopping

Honor the caller's format. Otherwise give the consequential assumption, supported objection or its absence, evidence, and the smallest informative test with its decision criterion and limits. Include actual results only for executed checks.

Stop when evidence resolves the assumption or the next informative step needs unavailable evidence, budget, or authority. State the limitation when no cheaper useful check exists. Do not change provider settings or deploy.

## Examples

- A plan assumes an index removes a bottleneck: inspect a representative query plan before proposing a service rewrite.
- Independent authorization and duplicate-charge failures: keep both; repairing one does not establish the other.
